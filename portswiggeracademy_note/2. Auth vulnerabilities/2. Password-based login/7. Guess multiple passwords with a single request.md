# User rate limiting
---
Another way _websites try to prevent brute-force attacks_ is through `user rate limiting`.
When making too many login requests within a short period of time. _It can block the IP address_.

Typically, the IP can only be _unblocked_ in one of the following ways:
- Automatically after a certain period of time has elapsed
- Manually by an administrator
- Manually by the user after successfully completing a CAPTCHA

As the limit is based on the rate of HTTP requests send from the user's IP address.
`Sometimes it's possible to bypass this defense mechanism if you can guess multiple passwords with a single request`.

# Lab: Broken brute-force protection, multiple credentials per request
---
1.  With Burp running, investigate the login page. 
	1. Notice that the `POST /login` request submits the login credentials in `JSON` format. 
	2. Send this request to Burp Repeater.
2.  In Burp Repeater, replace the single string value of the password with an array of strings containing all of the candidate passwords. 
	1. For example: `"username":"carlos", "password":["123456", "password", "qwerty" ...]`
3.  Send the request. This will return a `302` response.
4.  Right-click on this request and select **Show response in browser**. 
	1. Copy the URL and load it in the browser. 
	2. The page loads and you are logged in as `carlos`.
5.  Click **My account** to access Carlos's account page and solve the lab.
