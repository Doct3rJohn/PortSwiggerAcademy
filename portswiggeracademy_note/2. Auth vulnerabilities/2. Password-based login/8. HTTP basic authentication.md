# HTTP basic authentication
---
In `HTTP basic authentication`, the client receives an authentication token from the server.
Which is constructed by _concatenating the username and password_, and encoding it in `Base64` and automatically adds it to the `Authorization` header.
```plaintext
Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)
```

- Implementations of HTTP basic authentication often _vulnerable to being brute-force_.
- Also particularly vulnerable to session-related exploits, notably CSRF(_Cross-Site Request Forgery_).
