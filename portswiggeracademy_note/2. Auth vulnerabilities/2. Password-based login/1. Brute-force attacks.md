# Brute-force attacks
---
- A brute-force attack is when an attacker uses a system of trial and error in an attempt to guess valid user credentials.
- These attacks are typically automated using wordlists of usernames and passwords.
- Automating this process, especially using dedicated tools, potentially enables an attacker to make vast numbers of login attempts at high speed.

# Brute-force usernames
---
- _Usernames_ are especially easy to guess if they conform to a recognizable pattern, such as an email address. 
- For example, it is very common to see business logins in the format `firstname.lastname@somecompany.com`. 
- However, even if there is no obvious pattern, sometimes even high-privileged accounts are created using predictable usernames, such as `admin` or `administrator`.

# Brute-force passwords
---
- _Passwords_ can similarly be brute-force, with the difficulty varying based on the strength of the password.
- Many websites adopt some form of password policy.
- This typically involves enforcing passwords with:

	1. A minimum number of characters
	2. A mixture of lower and uppercase letters
	3. At least one special character

>[!example]
> If `mypassword` is not allowed, users may try something like `Mypassword1!` or `Myp4$$w0rd` instead.
