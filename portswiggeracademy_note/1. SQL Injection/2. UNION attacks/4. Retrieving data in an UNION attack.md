# Retrieving data in an UNION attack
---
- When you have [[2. Determining columns required in an UNION attack|determined]] the number of columns returned by the original query.
- And found which [[3. Finding columns to inject in UNION attack|columns]] can hold _string data_, you are in a position to retrieve interesting data:

Suppose that:
- The original query returns two columns, both of which can hold string data.
- The injection point is a quoted string within the `WHERE` clause.
- The database contains a table called `users` with the columns `username` and `password`.

In the situation, you can retrieve the contents of the `users` table by submitting the input:
```sql
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--
```

> [!note]
> _From: PortSwigger Academy_
> The crucial information needed to perform this attack is that there is a table called `users` with two columns called `username` and `password`.
> Without this information, you would be left trying to guess the names of tables and columns.
> In  fact, _all modern databases provide ways of examining the database structure_, to determine what tables and columns it contains.

# Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables
---
1. first, I need to determined 'how many columns' for the injection.
2. by using `ORDER BY`, I found its hit at `ORDER BY 3`
3. meaning, there are `2` columns.
4. then, using the payload `' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL`.
5. hits every columns and put the payload given. _above_
6. `' UNION SELECT username,password FROM users--` (_2 tabels "username","password"_)
