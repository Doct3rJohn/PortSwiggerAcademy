# What is UNION attacks
---
- When an application is vulnerable to SQLi and the results of the query are returned within the application's responses.
- The `UNION` keyword can be used to _retrieve data from other tables within the database._
- The `UNION` keyword _lets you execute one or more_ additional `SELECT` queries and append the results to the original query.
- For example:
```sql
SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2
```
- This SQL query will return a single result set with two columns, containing values from columns `a` and `b` in `table1` and columns `c` and `d` in `table2`.

For a `UNION` query to work, two key requirements must be met:
- The individual queries must return the same number of columns.
- The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries.

To carry out a UNION attacks, you need to ensure that your attacks meets these `two` requirements. This generally involves figuring out:
- How many columns are being returned from the original query?
- Which columns returned from the original query are of a suitable data types to hold the results from the injected query?
