# What is Blind SQLi and preventions
---
- _Blind SQLi_ arises when an application is vulnerable to SQLi
- But its _HTTP responses do not contain_ the results of the relevant _SQL query_ or the details of any _database errors_.

- With blind SQLi vulnerabilities, many techniques such as `UNION` attack. 
- Are not effective because they rely on being able to see the results of the injected query within the application's responses.
- It is still possible to exploit blind SQLi to access unauthorized data, but different techniques must be used.

# How to prevent blind SQL injection attacks?
---
- Although the techniques needed to find and exploit blind SQLi vulnerabilities are different and more sophisticated than for regular SQL injection.
- The measures needed to prevent SQL injection are the same regardless of whether the vulnerability is blind or not.

As with regular SQLi, blind SQLi attacks can be prevented through the careful use of parameterized queries, which ensure that user input cannot interfere with the structure of the intended SQL query.
